A3-1, A3-2, A3-3  
The iterations in this program ran x amount in the first thread before then running another x amount in the next thread and so on. When we used iterations that were not divisible by 4 it continued with the same pattern and resulted in threads being used at different rates.

A3-4, A3-5  
This is our code for the chunks of 1 program. This one was much easier to complete since we had already worked on the ploops program.

A3-6  
Unlike the previous program we created, this program ran one iteration in the first thread and then switched to the next thread where it ran the next iteration. This resulted in all threads being used a very similar amount as opposed to the previous program.

A3-7, A3-8  
This is our code for the reduction program. We had some issues with compilation errors but were able to figure out that our command was entered improperly.

A3-9  
We ran the reduction program with many numbers but were unable to produce a output that was different from the initial. This could be due to an error somewhere however after multiple run throughs we could not find any discrepancies with the provided code. The sequential and the parallel sums always matched.
